This is the beginning of the documentation for this program.

The Java compiler needs cleaning up, once it worked I focused on what's found in workingDir.

Essentially, the Java program compiles /workingDir/Forth/_minimal.asm into /workingDir/Output/compiled.asm,
and compiles /workingDir/Forth/_stdLib.forth into /workingDir/Output/_stdLib.obj.

compiled.asm then needs to be loaded into LC3Edit and assembled. Once that's done, first load _stdLib.obj,
then compiled.obj into the simulator and start.
